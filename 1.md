# Session 1. Course overview + Virtual machines & Linux 

## Motivation
As computer scientists, we know that computers are great at aiding in repetitive tasks. However, far too often, we forget that this applies just as much to our use of the computer as it does to the computations we want our programs to perform. We have a vast range of tools available at our fingertips that enable us to be more productive and solve more complex problems when working on any computer-related problem. Yet many of us utilize only a small fraction of those tools; we only know enough magical incantations by rote to get by, and blindly copy-paste commands from the internet when we get stuck.

This class is an attempt to address this.

We want to teach you how to make the most of the tools you know, show you new tools to add to your toolbox, and hopefully instill in you some excitement for exploring (and perhaps building) more tools on your own. This is what we believe to be the missing semester from most Computer Science curricula.


## Class structure
The class consists of 11 1-hour lectures, each one centering on a particular topic. The lectures are largely independent, though as the semester goes on we will presume that you are familiar with the content from the earlier lectures. We have lecture notes online, but there will be a lot of content covered in class (e.g. in the form of demos) that may not be in the notes. We will be recording lectures and posting the recordings online.

We are trying to cover a lot of ground over the course of just 11 1-hour lectures, so the lectures are fairly dense. To allow you some time to get familiar with the content at your own pace, each lecture includes a set of exercises that guide you through the lecture’s key points. After each lecture, we are hosting office hours where we will be present to help answer any questions you might have. If you are attending the class online, you can send us questions at missing-semester@mit.edu.

Due to the limited time we have, we won’t be able to cover all the tools in the same level of detail a full-scale class might. Where possible, we will try to point you towards resources for digging further into a tool or topic, but if something particularly strikes your fancy, don’t hesitate to reach out to us and ask for pointers!


## Virtual Machines

Virtual machines are simulated computers. You can configure a guest virtual
machine with some operating system and configuration and use it without
affecting your host environment.

For this class, you can use VMs to experiment with operating systems, software,
and configurations without risk: you won't affect your primary development
environment.

In general, VMs have lots of uses. They are commonly used for running software
that only runs on a certain operating system (e.g. using a Windows VM on Linux
to run Windows-specific software). They are often used for experimenting with
potentially malicious software.

### Useful features

- **Isolation**: hypervisors do a pretty good job of isolating the guest from
the host, so you can use VMs to run buggy or untrusted software reasonably
safely.

- **Snapshots**: you can take "snapshots" of your virtual machine, capturing
the entire machine state (disk, memory, etc.), make changes to your machine,
and then restore to an earlier state. This is useful for testing out
potentially destructive actions, among other things.

### Disadvantages

Virtual machines are generally slower than running on bare metal, so they may
be unsuitable for certain applications.

### Setup

- **Resources**: shared with host machine; be aware of this when allocating
physical resources.

- **Networking**: many options, default NAT should work fine for most use
cases.

- **Guest addons**: many hypervisors can install software in the guest to
enable nicer integration with host system. You should use this if you can.

### Resources

- Hypervisors
    - [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) (open-source)
    - [Virt-manager](https://virt-manager.org/) (open-source, manages KVM virtual machines and LXC containers)
    - [VMWare](https://www.vmware.com/) (commercial, available from IS&T [for
    MIT students](https://ist.mit.edu/vmware-fusion))

If you are already familiar with popular hypervisors/VMs you may want to learn more about how to do this from a command line friendly way. One option is the [libvirt](https://wiki.libvirt.org/page/UbuntuKVMWalkthrough) toolkit which allows you to manage multiple different virtualization providers/hypervisors.

### Exercises

1. Download and install a hypervisor.

1. Create a new virtual machine and install a Linux distribution (e.g.
[Debian](https://www.debian.org/)).

1. Experiment with snapshots. Try things that you've always wanted to try, like
   running `sudo rm -rf --no-preserve-root /`, and see if you can recover
   easily.

1. Read what a [fork-bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_bomb) (`:(){ :|:& };:`) is and run it on the VM to see that the resource isolation (CPU, Memory, &c) works.

1. Install guest addons and experiment with different windowing modes, file
   sharing, and other features.
